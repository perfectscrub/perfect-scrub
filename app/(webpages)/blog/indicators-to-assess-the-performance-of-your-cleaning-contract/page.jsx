              You are the Facility manager responsible for the look and feel of
              the office. You have hired a cleaning company who say they do
              scheduled cleaning as agreed with your company. However, how
              exactly are you checking and monitoring their activities. How are
              you measuring your return on investment. Yes, I am describing the
              service provided to your company as an investment.

              Let’s think about it. You are paying for services not only so you
              can return to a clean office every day, which is important. The
              other part of it, which I consider even more crucial, is that you
              are investing in the health and well being of your staff.
              Investing in disease prevention and limiting the spread of
              infection as well. If an infection were to break out, we
              immediately put thousands of dollars and potentially hundreds of
              billable hours at risk.

              Now that we have a little more insight on the value of your
              investment, let’s talk about how we are ensuring its paying
              dividends. You should ensure you are receiving the dividends from
              your significant investment by regularly evaluating the
              performance of those you have entrusted to clean your facility. It
              is important to ask the right questions to ensure they are
              delivering exactly what they promised your company at the start.{" "}
