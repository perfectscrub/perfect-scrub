              disorganization in the office can cause a sense of chaos and
              overwhelm. A clean and organized workspace can help reduce stress

              </span>
              : A clean office allows employees to focus better on their tasks
              without distractions. When the environment is tidy, it's easier to

              <span className="font-semibold">Physical Health Benefits</span>: A
              clean office is less likely to retain dust, allergens, and germs,
              which contribute to respiratory issues and other health problems.
              Better physical health of your staff can positively impact their
              mental well-being and ultimately productivity.

              wander and explore new ideas more freely.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">

              An organized office can help employees complete tasks more
              efficiently, potentially reducing the need for excessive overtime
