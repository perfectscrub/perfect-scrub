              Day-cares and preschools are places where toddlers, their parents,
              staff, and school administrators experience immense joy and
              satisfaction. It is undeniable that the health and safety of these
              little children should be the top priority in such facilities,
              considering their vulnerability to germs and diseases in their
              immediate environment.
