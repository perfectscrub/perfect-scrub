            Our standard commercial cleaning service encompasses a range of
            tasks to ensure a clean and sanitized environment. This includes
            dusting, sweeping, mopping, disinfecting, and sanitizing all
            washrooms. We also handle garbage removal and disposal, as well as
            thorough cleaning of all visible surfaces. You have the flexibility
            to choose the frequency of our cleaning service, whether it's on a
            daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

            Additionally, we provide the option to customize your cleaning
            schedule to better suit your specific needs. When we begin our
            regular cleaning services, we offer one standard clean with a
            comprehensive deep clean.
