                You are the Facility manager responsible for the look and feel
                of the office. You have hired a cleaning company who say they do
                scheduled cleaning as agreed with your company. However, how
                exactly are you checking and monitoring their activities. How
                are you measuring your return on investment. Yes, I am
                describing the service provided to your company as an
                investment.

                Let’s think about it. You are paying for services not only so
                you can return to a clean office every day, which is important.
                The other part of it, which I consider even more crucial, is
                that you are investing in the health and well being of your
                staff. Investing in disease prevention and limiting the spread
                of infection as well. If an infection were to break out, we
                immediately put thousands of dollars and potentially hundreds of
                billable hours at risk.

                Now that we have a little more insight on the value of your
                investment, let’s talk about how we are ensuring its paying
                dividends. You should ensure you are receiving the dividends
                from your significant investment by regularly evaluating the
                performance of those you have entrusted to clean your facility.
                It is important to ask the right questions to ensure they are
                delivering exactly what they promised your company at the start.{" "}

                As a buyer of cleaning services, how do you hold your provider

                KPIs, or Key Performance Indicators, are established

                As a facility manager, Key Performance Indicators tell you a
                story about the effectiveness of your service provider relative
                to your agreed cleaning requirements. The following KPI’s are
                very valuable in assessing the performance of your cleaning
                vendors and highlighting areas of improvement.
